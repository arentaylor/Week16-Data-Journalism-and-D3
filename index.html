          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Certain Demographics</h2>
          <p>This visualization is based on information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 
            Each dot is a state, and their location on the graph will shift to reflect the relationship between the selections on the X and Y axis.
          </p>

          <p>There is a poor relationship between the median age in each state and the negative health indicators. However, a few outliers are interesting. Note that TX has
            an unusally high rate of lack of health insurance. The other factors, poverty and household income (which are related to each other, of course), have a more clear
            relationship with the negative health outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>Though the relationship between poverty and smoking is not especially strong, it is still surprising considering the high cost of cigarettes. Notice, however, that states
            closer to the top-left quadrant are states with lower taxes on cigarattes (e.g. Kentucky, West Virginia, Lousiana, etc.).
